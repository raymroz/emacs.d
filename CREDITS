= WHERE PEOPLE GET THEIR PROPS =

My base environment has been shamelessly ripped from the work of Ryan McGuire over at
EnigmaCurry.com.  In the process of trying to locate a nice Python environment for Emacs
after recently changing jobs, I found Ryan's setup and decided to base my own on it. Much
of the Python material was taken from him.  I plan on integrating my own Perl and C/C++
environments into this format as well and will post it soon.  Furthermore, I expect that
I will make changes and modifications to Ryan's Python base environment as necessity
dictates and as I put my own prints on everything.  Thanks Ryan for your hard work in
developing a very nice Python environment for Emacs.

Furthmore, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the lovely girls who walk
down beneath my office window on Barrington Street in downtown Halifax, Nova Scotia. It
has been a fine summer and I thank you all!
